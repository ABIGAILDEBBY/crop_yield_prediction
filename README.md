## Crop Yield Prediction Project - README

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the Crop Yield Prediction project, including its purpose, functionality, usage instructions, and technical details.

**Project Description**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting crop yield based on various agricultural factors.  The model can be used by farmers, researchers, and agricultural organizations to estimate potential crop yields and make informed decisions.

**Features**

* **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loads agricultural data from a CSV file and performs necessary preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
* **Machine Learning Model Training:** Trains various machine learning models (Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors) to predict crop yield.
* **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates the performance of trained models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared score.
* **Prediction:** Makes predictions for crop yield on new data points based on the chosen model.
* **Model Persistence:** Saves the best performing model for future use using joblib.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (Optional):**  Provides basic EDA functionalities to visualize data distributions and relationships between features (commented out by default).

**Requirements**
These requirements are saved in a requirements.txt file
* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* joblib

**Installation**

1. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

   It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies from your system-wide Python installation. You can use tools like `venv` or `conda` to create virtual environments. Refer to their documentation for specific instructions.

2. **Install required libraries:**

   Once your virtual environment is activated, install the required libraries using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
